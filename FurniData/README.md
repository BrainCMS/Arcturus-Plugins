# FurniData

FurniData is an Arcturus Plugin by ArpyAge.

Installing a plugin is simple! Simply place the `FurniData.jar` file into your `/plugins` folder.

Remember once adding a Plugin you'll need to reboot Arcturus Emulator. Don't forget to give yourself (and sometimes users) permission to use any command, this can be done via your database `permissions` table.

---

When using the command `:furnidata` (or whatever you set it in your texts) the next item you activate (double-click) will show all information of the furniture in a nice pop-up including items_base id and real name, you can use `:furnidata` again to make it stop working (also it won't actually activate the item).

### Database Modifications

FurniData requires no database modification / SQL queries. The plugin may automatically create the required database changes upon relaunching Arcturus Emulator.
