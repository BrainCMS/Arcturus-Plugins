# Arcturus Plugins

Installing a plugin is simple! Simply place the `.jar` file into your `/plugins` folder.

Remember once adding a Plugin you'll need to reboot Arcturus Emulator. Don't forget to give yourself (and sometimes users) permission to use any command, this can be done via your database `permissions` table.
